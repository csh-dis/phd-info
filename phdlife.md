## PhD LIFE AT CSH

### Desks


#### Requesting a new desk

### Lunch
There is no canteen, cafeteria, mensa, etc. at CSH but there are shared tables in the large kitchen and outdoors for eating together. Many people bring their lunches or bring supplies to cook \(only very simple cooking is possible\). Others buy take-away nearby. *Note that there are limited nearby take-away options in the Metternichgasse.* You are invited to use the small refrigerators on each floor to store your food – though please be responsible for making sure that it is removed before it gets disgusting.

### Tea Time
Every day \(Monday - Friday\) at 16:00, everyone at CSH is invited to gather for tea. This is an opportunity to discuss research ideas; get informal advice on projects; hear about conferences, courses, and talks; meet CSH visitors and guests; and otherwise chat about what is happening. Tea is organized by the Operations Team, though everyone is asked to help by disposing of waste in the trash bins and taking used cups, plates, etc. to a dishwasher.

### PhD Student Representatives
CSH PhD students have representation in faculty meetings and other institutional governance bodies by invitation. The goal of this representation is two-way exchange: what issues of importance to the faculty and/or CSH leadership affect students? what issues faced by students should be addressed by the faculty and/or leadership?

Current representatives:
- Ola Ali
- Jan Fialkowski
- Niraj Kushwaha

Past representatives:
- Tobias Reisch
- Katharina Ledebur
