### CONTRACT
- Doctoral students will recieve an employment contract for a PhD research position at the Austrian funding agency FWF standard of 30 hours per week and EUR 34500 per year before tax and other withholdings. Students will recieve health insurance and social benefits as well. You can estimate your income [here](https://bruttonetto.arbeiterkammer.at/).
- The initial contract is for 1 year, but students will usually have a commitment of 3 years in the formal offer letter, which should be sufficient for e.g. visa or residency purposes. The contract will either be issued by CSH or by one of our partner universities.
<!--
- Students are employed as researchers at CSH, with the expectation that they will use the research performed at CSH as their thesis research for the doctoral degree. The 30-hour per week contract reflects the average time throughout the duration of the contract that will be spent on the research project that is defined in the contract and/or will be defined in consultation with their advisor. Other time spent on research or academic requirements is considered part of academic training and education.
-->
- Students who must apply for a residency permit \("Aufenthaltstitel"\), i.e. those from outside the EU/EEA/CH, will recieve a hosting agreement with research appointment \("Aufnahmevereinbarung mit der Forschungseinrichtung"\) from CSH as a supplemental document to the standard contract. See RESIDENCY below.

### TRAVEL
ðŸš§  under construction  ðŸš§
<details><summary><b>Arriving to Vienna</b></summary>

-->

  </details>
<br />
<details><summary><b>Within Vienna</b></summary>

  - Wiener Linien operates public transportation throughout the city
  - Download the app **WienMobil** to purchase tickets \(Paypal or credit card\) and plan routes
  - Once you enroll at a university, you will be eligible for a Semesterkarte
  - Prior to enrollment, the 31 Days VIENNA ticket is probably the best value if you will be using public transportation for more than 10 round-trips per month

  </details>
<br />
<details><summary><b>Around Austria</b></summary>

  - If you will need to commute to Graz on a regular basis, it will likely be most economical to purchase a OeBB [discount card](https://www.oebb.at/de/tickets-kundenkarten/kundenkarten/vorteilscard), such as the Vorteilscard Jugend \(under 26 years\) or Vorteilscard 66
<!--  - Students are eligible for reimbursement of the cost of the rail pass each year they are enrolled at TU Graz for doctoral studies.-->

### BANK ACCOUNT
<details><summary><b>Good to know</b></summary>
  
  - You will need:
    - proof of your registration \(*Anmeldung eines Wohnsitz*\)
    - an employment contract
    - your passport
  - Even if you have an EU bank account with IBAN, there may be reasons why having an AT-based account is helpful â€“ for instance, for particular phone or internet contracts 

  </details>
<br />
  
### SHOPPING
<details><summary><b>Good to know</b></summary>
  
  - Shops close earlier than what you might be used to, especially on Saturdays and especially *Apotheke*
  - No shops are open on Sundays except for grocery shops at train stations and the airport

  </details>
<br />

### HEALTHCARE
ðŸš§  under construction  ðŸš§
<details><summary><b>Good to know</b></summary>
  
  - All healthcare is managed through your [e-card](https://www.chipkarte.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.678532&portal=ecardportal), for which you will need to register in person at a local authority. The e-card is sent by post some months after registering.
  - The e-card is a physical card that you should take to doctor appointments and pharmacy visits. If you forget your card â€“ and before it arrives â€“ you can give the doctor your social security number, which is a 4-digit number followed by your birthdate in DDMMYY format.
  - To a large extent, you will be able to decide on the doctors you visit and where you go for care. A centralized system **will not** make decisions or appointments for you. For some services, however, you may need the referral of a general practitioner, so identify one soon.
  - Not all doctors will accept the public insurance plan. Check for "alle Krankenkassen" \("all health insurers"\) or Ã–sterreichischen Gesundheitskasse \(Ã–GK\).

  </details>
<br />

### PHONE
