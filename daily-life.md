- The two types of rental contracts you will see are fixed-term \("befristet"\) and unlimited \("unbefristet"\). Unlimited contracts are generally in the renter's interest and can be cancelled by the renter with advance notice.

- For Altbau, there is a limit to the rent that should be charged. You can find the calculator for Vienna [here](https://mietervereinigung.at/706/MietzinsrechnerModule) \(most apartments are category A\)

<details><summary><b>Around Austria</b></summary>

  - If you will need to commute to Graz on a regular basis, it will likely be most economical to purchase a OeBB [discount card](https://www.oebb.at/de/tickets-kundenkarten/kundenkarten/vorteilscard), such as the Vorteilscard Jugend \(under 26 years\), Vorteilscard 66, or the Klimaticket

### HEALTHCARE
🚧  under construction  🚧
<details><summary><b>Good to know</b></summary>
  
  - All healthcare is managed through your [e-card](https://www.chipkarte.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.678532&portal=ecardportal), for which you will need to register in person at a local authority. The e-card is sent by post some months after registering.
  - The e-card is a physical card that you should take to doctor appointments and pharmacy visits. If you forget your card – and before it arrives – you can give the doctor your social security number, which is a 4-digit number followed by your birthdate in DDMMYY format.
  - To a large extent, you will be able to decide on the doctors you visit and where you go for care. A centralized system **will not** make decisions or appointments for you. For some services, however, you may need the referral of a general practitioner, so identify one soon.
  - Not all doctors will accept the public insurance plan. Check for "alle Krankenkassen" \("all health insurers"\) or Österreichischen Gesundheitskasse \(ÖGK\).
