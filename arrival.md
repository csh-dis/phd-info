### ANMELDUNG EINES WOHNSITZ

- All people settling in Austria must [register their residency](https://www.wien.gv.at/english/living-working/registration/) within 3 days of moving in. The process must be completed each time you change your residency.
- The [Meldezettel form](https://www.wien.gv.at/verwaltung/meldeservice/pdf/meldezettel.pdf) must be delivered personally to one of the [Meldeservice office for your district](https://www.wien.gv.at/verwaltung/meldeservice/stellen.html). You can make an appointment online. You can change your residency online through ID-Austria \(see below\), which requires registration in person at the local authority.
- You may also need:
  - birth certificate
  - passport
  - rental contract
  - *if you wish to have your academic degree included in your name* you will need your degree
- Once you are registered, you must de-register when you are leaving Austria permanently.

### E-CARD / SOCIAL SECURITY

- Within a few days of beginning your employment, you will recieve an invitation letter for a specific date and time to complete the registration for your e-Card.
- You will need:
  - your AT social security number: XXXX DD MM YYYY with your birthdate
  - passport or other legal photo identification
  - passport photo
  - appointment letter
- You can get a photo from the local authorities. Book an appointment [online](https://citizen.bmi.gv.at/at.gv.bmi.fnsetvweb-p/etv/public/Terminvereinbarung). It is also fine to bring a photo if you already have one.


### ID-AUSTRIA

- Digital portal for Handy \(mobile phone\) signatures and a few bureaucratic proceses, including An- and Abmeldung of your place of residence
- Non-AT citizens must apply with the Landespolizeidirektion for their district – the same location you will be visiting for your e-Card but a different office. You can make an [appointment online](https://citizen.bmi.gv.at/at.gv.bmi.fnsetvweb-p/etv/public/sva/Terminvereinbarung). Look for "ID Austria - Registration"
- You will need:
  - passport or other legal photo identification
  - passport photo
  - a document that attests to your presence in AT, e.g. employment contract, student ID, registration
- Download the app "Digitales Amt" and pre-register; you will be able to finish registration through the app once you visit the Landespolizeidirektion
