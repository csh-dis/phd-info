  - appointment letter
- You can get a photo from the local authorities. Book an appointment [online](https://citizen.bmi.gv.at/at.gv.bmi.fnsetvweb-p/etv/public/Terminvereinbarung). It is also fine to bring a photo if you already have one.

<br />

### ID-AUSTRIA

- Digital portal for Handy \(mobile phone\) signatures and a few bureaucratic proceses, including An- and Abmeldung of your place of residence
- Non-AT citizens must apply with the Landespolizeidirektion for their district – the same location you will be visiting for your e-Card but a different office. You can make an [appointment online](https://citizen.bmi.gv.at/at.gv.bmi.fnsetvweb-p/etv/public/sva/Terminvereinbarung). Look for "ID Austria - Registration"

  - a document that attests to your presence in AT, e.g. employment contract, student ID, registration
- Download the app "Digitales Amt" and pre-register; you will be able to finish registration through the app once you visit the Landespolizeidirektion
