### Scientific computing
*Each project may have specific server requirements depending on the data and level of security needed. Consult with your advisor to understand the specifics of the data and/or server you will be using.*
#### For "everyday" computing
CSH operates the GBD GPU computing server, which can be used to run less intensive jobs – ideally under 120 hours run-time. GBD does not have a queuing system so users should check current usage before submitting a job. For access to GBD, contact the [Head of Scientific Computing](stuetz@csh.ac.at). For access to VPN, contact the [System Administrator](systemadmin@csh.ac.at).
#### For computationally intensive computing
CSH is eligible to run jobs on Austria's most powerful supercomputers as part of the [Vienna Scientific Cluster](https://vsc.ac.at//systems/). To run jobs at the VSC, **the project leader** \(i.e. your advisor\) must [request access](https://vsc.ac.at//access/project-application/). You will need to estimate the computational resources needed. Once a project is approved/accepted, the project leader gains access and creates user accounts. VSC projects have a lifetime of one year but are eligible for renewal. The [VSC wiki](https://wiki.vsc.ac.at/doku.php?id=start) contains documentation. 

### Hard drive back-ups
CSH **does not** have a centralized system for hard drive back-ups. Nextcloud is available for back-up storage but is not compatible with some operating systems. Consult with your advisor to determine the best system for your needs.

### Journals
Once you enroll at a university, you should gain access to relevant online journals through your university ID. For any papers that you cannot find through your library or otherwise free online, crowd-sourcing within CSH is a good option: Post your request in Slack \(often these end up in #general\).

### CSH Library
If you need a book – popular title, textbook, edited volume, etc. – that is important to your research and cannot be found in either your university library or online as a free pdf, and that is of sufficient potential interest to other researchers at CSH, you are welcome to request a book purchase by CSH. 
Books should be in English to ensure they are accessible to everyone at CSH; books in other languages will be considered for special cases. All books purchased by CSH become property of CSH \(i.e. remain at CSH after you leave\) and should be made available to other researchers who wish to use them.

To request a book:
- Ensure that we do not already own the title by checking the library holdings list below.
- Find a link to a current, inexpensive purchase option valid for AT, i.e. consider shipping costs when looking at prices. Especially for textbooks or other older, out-of-print titles which can be very expensive, look for [used books](https://www.abebooks.com/).
- Send the request and the purchase link to [office@csh.ac.at](mailto:office@csh.ac.at). Your request should include a **brief** justification of why the book is important for your research: how did you hear about the book, how might what you learn from the book advance your work, or any other relevant information.

*Books requests that exceed a certain cost will be reviewed by the CSH librarian. You may need to provide additional details.*
