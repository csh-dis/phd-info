### Journals
Once you enroll at a university, you should gain access to many relevant online journals through your university ID. For any papers that you cannot find for free online, crowd-sourcing within CSH is a good option: Post your request in Slack \(often these end up in #general\).

### CSH Library
If you need a book – popular title, textbook, edited volume, etc. – that is important to your research and cannot be found in either your university library or online as a free pdf, and that you believe is of sufficient potential interest to other researchers at CSH, you are welcome to request a book purchase by CSH. Books should be in English to ensure they are accessible to everyone at CSH; books in other languages will be considered for special cases. All books purchased by CSH become property of CSH and should be made available to other researchers who wish to use them.

To request a book:
- Ensure that we do not already own the title by checking the library list below.
- Find a link to a current, inexpensive purchase option valid for AT, i.e. consider shipping costs when looking at prices. Especially for textbooks or other older, out-of-print titles which can be very expensive, look for [used books](https://www.abebooks.com/).
- Send the request and the purchase link to [office@csh.ac.at](mailto:office@csh.ac.at). Your request should include a **brief** justification of why the book is important for your research: how did you hear about the book, how might what you learn from the book advance your work, or any other relevant information.
*Books requests that exceed a certain cost will be reviewed by the CSH librarian. You may need to provide additional details.*
