## PROCESS
### advisor approval
You will need your advisor's approval â€“ and in many cases, their financial support â€“ to pursue a research visit or conference. Discuss with your advisor before applying to any program. 

Depending on the funding source of your salary, it might not be possible to participate in certain longer-term research and training activities during your employment on a particular project. See below.

### CSH approval
Depending on the funding source for your salary, it might not be possible to participate in certain longer-term research and training activities during your employment on a particular project is ongoing. Check with the CSH Grant Executive Officer \(if you are paid by your advisor\) or with the CSH graduate program \(if you are paid by the program\).

If you would like to apply for the the Ã–AW International Communication program, you will not apply as an individutal but instead CSH will submit an application on your behalf. Please contact the CSH Grant Executive Officer as early as possible to discuss your application.

### university approval
You ***might*** need to request a leave of absence from your university in the case of research visits or training programs â‰¥4 weeks. The policies governing leave are university-wide and independent of the particular program of study.
- [TUWien](https://www.tuwien.at/studium/studieren-an-der-tuw/beurlaubung)
- [UniWien](https://doktorat.univie.ac.at/en/doctoralphd-programmes/leave-of-absence/)
*more information coming soon*

## CONSIDERATIONS
### visas & residency requirements
If you require a residency permit to stay/study/work in AT, you may need to consult with the MA 35 before pursuing research opportunities outside of those associated with your residency permit (for instance, as described in the "Aufnahmevereinbarung" from CSH).
